Introduction
======================

**Definition:** The HPC-stack is a repository that provides a unified, shell script-based build system to build the software stack required for numerical weather prediction (NWP) tools such as the `Unified Forecast System (UFS) <https://ufscommunity.org/>`__ and the `Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) <https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`__ framework. 

Background
------------------------
The `HPC-Stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/hpc-stack.git>`__ provides libraries and dependencies in a consistent manner for NWP applications. It is part of the `NCEPLIBS project <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS>`__ and is model/system agnostic. The HPC-Stack was originally written to facilitate installation of third-party libraries in a systematic manner on macOS and Linux systems (specifically RHEL). It was later transferred, expanded and further enhanced in the `Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) <https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`__ project.
